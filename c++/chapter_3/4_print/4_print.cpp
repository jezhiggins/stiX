// print copies each of its argument files in turn to its
// output, inserting page headers and footers and filling
// last page of each file to full length. A header
// consists of two blank lines, a line giving the filename
// and page number, and two more blank lines; a footer
// consists of two blank lines. Pages for each file are
// numbers starting at one. If no arguments are specified,
// print prints its standard input; the file nameis null.
// The text of each file is unmodified - no attempt is made
// to fold line lines or expands tabs to spaces.
