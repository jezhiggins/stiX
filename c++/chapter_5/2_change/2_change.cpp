// of the matched string. The patterns accept by change are
// the same as those used by find.
// The replacement string newstuff consists of zero or more
// of the following elements
//   c        literal character c
//   &        ditto, i.e. whatever was matched
//   @c       escaped character c (e.g. @&)
//
// To parenthesize all sums and differences of identifiers
//   change "*[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*[ ]*[+-][ ]*[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*" (&)
