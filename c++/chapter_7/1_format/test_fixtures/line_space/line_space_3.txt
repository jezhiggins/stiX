Good Programming is not learned from generalities,
but by seeing how significant programs can be made
clean, easy to read, easy to maintain and modify,
human-engineered, efficient, and reliable, by the
application of common sense and good programming
practices. Careful study and imitation of good programs
leads to better writing.
